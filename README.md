# Foosball Ranking System

This is a fun react project to allow foosball's players to track their ranking.

To start, you would need to have `node`, `npm` and optional `yarn`

Install all the dependency packages
```bash
npm i
```
and start the project with
```bash
npm start
```

Since this is a fun project, below are some other things that I would like to do with it:
- [ ] Make it mobile friendly - responsive styling
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add a graph to show wins/loses over time
- [ ] Allows a draw game and use a proper algorithm to calculate ranking
- [ ] General UI improvement would be nice too

This app uses [react static boilerplate](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate) as the seed
